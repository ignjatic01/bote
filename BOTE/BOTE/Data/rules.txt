1. The game is played by two players on one computer. Before the game starts, both players choose their emperor.
2. The game takes place on a battlefield divided into 9 territories (3x3). Player 1 controls four territories and plays first. There are 3 types of troops: infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Each turn begins by drawing a card, which can provide the player with an additional unit (random number between 1 and number of fields in possession). In each turn, only one attack can be made. When an attack is initiated, a battle begins. The winner of the battle is the one who has the most points in that battle. A battle can only occur between two adjacent fields...
3. The points are calculated as follows: 3 points per catapult, 2 points per cavalry, and 1 point per infantry. To the total points from the units, a number between 0 and 6 is added, representing a random external factor affecting the battle. If the attacker wins, they capture the territory. In case of defeat, the attacker loses half of units on the territory, while the defending player doesn't loses soldiers.
4. The winner is the player who captures all the territories.
